Installation
============

scmdata is tested to work with Python 3.6 and above



Installing with conda
---------------------

The easiest way to install scmdata is using conda, either using the full
`Anaconda <https://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/>`_ distribution which includes a collection of
popular data science packages or the smaller
`Miniconda <https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html>`_ distribution. Using conda
is the recommended method for installing scmdata for most users.

.. code:: bash

    conda install -c conda-forge scmdata

Installing with pip
-------------------

scmdata can also be installed from `PyPi <https://pypi.org/>`_ using pip.

We recommend creating a virtual environment to manage this and any other libraries your
project requires.

.. code:: bash

    pip install scmdata
